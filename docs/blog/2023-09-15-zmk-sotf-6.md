Welcome to the sixth ZMK "State Of The Firmware" (SOTF)!

This update will cover all the major activity since [SOTF #5](/blog/2022/04/10/zmk-sotf-5). That was over a year ago (again!), so there are many new exciting features and plenty of improvements to cover!

## Recent Activity

Here's a summary of the various major changes since last time, broken down by theme:

### Keymaps/Behaviors

#### Hold-tap improvements

[andrewjrae] added the [global quick tap property](../docs/behaviors/hold-tap.md#global-quick-tap) to the hold-tap behavior in [#1187](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/pull/1187), which prevents the hold behavior from triggering if it hasn't been a certain duration since the last key press. This is a useful feature to prevent accidental hold activations during quick typing and made its way into many keymaps!

[urob] added the [`hold-trigger-on-release` property](../docs/behaviors/hold-tap.md#positional-hold-tap-and-hold-trigger-key-positions) in [#1423](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/pull/1423). This significantly increases the usefulness of positional constraints on hold-taps, since it allows combining multiple holds such as different modifiers for home-row mods usage.

#### Masking mods in mod-morphs

[aumuell], [vrinek] and [urob] contributed to improving the behavior of [mod-morphs](../docs/behaviors/mod-morph.md) by masking the triggering modifiers and added `keep-mods` property in [#1412](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/pull/1412). This unlocks more use cases for mod-morphs, since you are no longer constrained to emitting keycodes that work well with the triggering modifier keycodes.

#### Parameterized macros

[petejohanson] added [macros that can be parameterized](../docs/behaviors/macros.md#parameterized-macros) with one or two parameters in [#1232](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/pull/1232). This allows users to define macros in a more modular way and is a nice quality-of-life improvement.

#### Arbitrary behaviors on encoder rotation

[nickconway] and [petejohanson] added [sensor rotation behaviors](../docs/behaviors/sensor-rotate.md) to allow invoking arbitrary behaviors from encoders [#1758](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/pull/1758). Previously encoder rotations could only invoke the key-press behavior `&kp` through the `&inc_dec_kp` binding, whereas now you can define new sensor rotation behaviors to invoke others.

(Note that currently behaviors that have "locality" such as `&rgb_ug` do not work as expected via encoder rotation bindings in split keyboards, due to issue [#1494](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/issues/1494).)

#### Key toggle behavior

[cgoates] added the [key toggle behavior](../docs/behaviors/key-toggle.md) in [#1278](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/pull/1278), which can be used via its `&kt` binding to toggle the state of a keycode between pressed and released.

#### Bug fixes and other improvements

[petejohanson], [andrewjrae] and [okke-formsma] tracked down and fixed an issue causing stuck keys when there are combos on key positions involving hold-tap behaviors in [#1411](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/pull/1411). This was an elusive bug that took a lot of effort from the community to nail down and fix!

[nguyendown] and [joelspadin] tracked down and fixed a couple tricky issues causing stuck keys with [sticky keys](../docs/behaviors/sticky-key.md) in [#1586](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/pull/1586), [#1745](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/pull/1745).

[okke-formsma] fixed an issue allowing tap dances to be invoked by combos in [#1518](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/pull/1518).

[petejohanson] tweaked the caps word behavior to ignore modifiers in [#1330](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/pull/1330).

### Bluetooth and Split Improvements

#### Multiple peripherals

[xudongzheng] contributed to add support for more than one peripheral per keyboard in [#836](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/pull/836). This allows setups such as split keyboards with more than two halves, or enable a BLE-based "dongle mode" via a third device running ZMK that can stay connected to a computer via USB.

Note that documentation is still lacking for utilizing more than one peripheral and there will potentially be changes in the build system to allow for more seamless configuration.

#### Pairing passkey requirement

[petejohanson] added [the option to require passkey input](../docs/config/bluetooth.md) while pairing to new devices in [#1822](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/pull/1822). Enabling this will require you to enter a six digit passcode via the number keys on your keymap and press enter when pairing to a new device, enhancing security during the pairing procedure.

#### Split keyboard improvements

[petejohanson] contributed a fix to release held keys on peripheral disconnect [#1340](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/pull/1340), which makes scenarios where a split disconnects unexpectedly less painful.

[petejohanson] also improved [the `settings_reset` shield](../docs/troubleshooting.md#split-keyboard-halves-unable-to-pair) by making it clear bonds more reliably, and allow it to build for all boards in [#1879](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/pull/1879).

[petejohanson] and [xudongzheng] contributed additional split connectivity improvements, via using directed advertising in [#1913](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/pull/1913) and improving the robustness of central scanning in [#1912](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/pull/1912).

## Thanks!

<!-- TODO -->

As we approach the two year birthday for ZMK, I am reminded of how far we have come in such a short time, in large part thanks to the _amazing_ community that has grown around it. I am so grateful to have so many contributors, testers, and user believing in the project and helping make it a joy to work on.
