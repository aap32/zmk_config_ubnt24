## 1. Install Zephyr Dependencies

Open Zephyr's [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/3.5.0/develop/getting_started/index.html) and follow the instructions under these sections:

- [Select and Update OS](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/3.5.0/develop/getting_started/index.html#select-and-update-os)
- [Install Dependencies](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/3.5.0/develop/getting_started/index.html#install-dependencies)

:::info
Zephyr's [Install Linux Host Dependencies](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/3.5.0/develop/getting_started/installation_linux.html) page may be of use for users of Linux distributions which are not based on Ubuntu.
:::

## 2. Source Code

Next, you'll need to clone the ZMK source repository if you haven't already. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder you would like to place your `zmk` directory in, then run the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk.git
```

Then step into the repository.

```sh
cd zmk
```

## 3. Get Zephyr and install Python dependencies

:::note
These steps are very similar to Zephyr's [Get Zephyr and install Python dependencies](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/3.5.0/develop/getting_started/index.html#get-zephyr-and-install-python-dependencies) instructions, but specialized for ZMK.

1. Use `apt` to install Python `venv` package:

```sh
sudo apt install python3-venv
```

2. Create a new virtual environment and activate it:

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="win">

1. Create a new virtual environment:

```sh
python -m venv .venv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

</TabItem>
</OsTabs>

Once activated your shell will be prefixed with `(.venv)`. The virtual environment can be deactivated at any time by running `deactivate`.

:::note
Remember to activate the virtual environment every time you start working.

4. Install west:

```sh
pip install west
```

5. Initialize the application and update to fetch modules, including Zephyr:

```sh
west init -l app/
west update
```

:::tip
This step pulls down quite a bit of tooling, be patient!
:::

6. Export a [Zephyr CMake package](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/3.5.0/build/zephyr_cmake_package.html#cmake-pkg). This allows CMake to automatically load boilerplate code required for building Zephyr applications.

```sh
west zephyr-export
```

7. Install the additional dependencies found in Zephyr's `requirements-base.txt`:

```sh
pip install -r zephyr/scripts/requirements-base.txt
```

## 4. Install Zephyr SDK

Return to Zephyr's Getting Started Guide and [Install Zephyr SDK](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/3.5.0/develop/getting_started/index.html#install-zephyr-sdk).

### OS specific notes

<OsNoteTabs>

<TabItem value="win">
  `dfu-util` is required to flash devices that use DFU, but there is currently
  no maintained package for it on Chocolatey. [QMK
  Toolbox](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox) contains a working version of it
  though.
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="raspberryos">
#### Install Cross-Compile Toolchain

Because Raspberry OS runs on the same architecture (but different ABI) as ARM keyboard MCUs, the operating system's installed [cross compilers](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/3.5.0/develop/toolchains/other_x_compilers.html) can be used to target the different ABI. Building for non-ARM MCUs has not been tested.

First, the cross compiler should be installed:

```sh
sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi
```

Next, we'll configure Zephyr with some [environment variables](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/3.5.0/develop/env_vars.html#env-vars) needed to find the cross compiler. Create a file named `~/.zephyrrc` if it doesn't exist, and add these lines to it:

```sh
export ZEPHYR_TOOLCHAIN_VARIANT=cross-compile
export CROSS_COMPILE=/usr/bin/arm-none-eabi-
```

</TabItem>

</OsNoteTabs>

Your setup is now complete.
