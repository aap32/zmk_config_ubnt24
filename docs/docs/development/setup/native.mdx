## Install Zephyr and West

1. Open Zephyr's [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/3.5.0/develop/getting_started/index.html) and follow the instructions under these sections:

- [Select and Update OS](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/3.5.0/develop/getting_started/index.html#select-and-update-os)
- [Install Dependencies](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/3.5.0/develop/getting_started/index.html#install-dependencies)

  :::info
  Zephyr's [Install Linux Host Dependencies](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/3.5.0/develop/getting_started/installation_linux.html) page may be of use for distributions which are not based on Ubuntu.
  :::

2. Next, follow steps 1-4 from [Get Zephyr and install Python dependencies](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html#get-zephyr-and-install-python-dependencies).

3. ZMK comes with its own copy of Zephyr, so you don't need to add a fresh copy to a separate directory.

```sh
west init -l app/
west update
```

:::tip
This step pulls down quite a bit of tooling. Go grab a cup of coffee, it can take 10-15 minutes even on a good internet connection!
:::

4. Export a [Zephyr CMake package](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/3.5.0/build/zephyr_cmake_package.html#cmake-pkg). This allows CMake to automatically load boilerplate code required for building Zephyr applications.

```sh
west zephyr-export
```

5. ZMK does not need all of the additional dependencies found in Zephyr's `requirements.txt`, but it does need those found in `requirements-base.txt`

```sh
pip3 install -r zephyr/scripts/requirements-base.txt
```

6. Return to Zephyr's Getting Started Guide and [Install Zephyr SDK](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/3.5.0/develop/getting_started/index.html#install-zephyr-sdk)

Your setup is now complete.

6. Return to Zephyr's Getting Started Guide and [Install Zephyr SDK](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/3.5.0/develop/getting_started/index.html#install-zephyr-sdk)

:::note
`dfu-util` is required to flash devices that use DFU, but there is currently no maintained package for it on Chocolatey. [QMK Toolbox](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox) contains a working version of it though.

#### Install Cross-Compile Toolchain

Because Raspberry OS runs on the same architecture (but different ABI) as ARM keyboard MCUs, the operating system's installed [cross compilers](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/3.5.0/develop/toolchains/other_x_compilers.html) can be used to target the different ABI. Building for non-ARM MCUs has not been tested.

First, the cross compiler should be installed:

```sh
sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi
```

Next, we'll configure Zephyr with some [environment variables](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/3.5.0/develop/env_vars.html#env-vars) needed to find the cross compiler. Create a file named `~/.zephyrrc` if it doesn't exist, and add these lines to it:

```sh
export ZEPHYR_TOOLCHAIN_VARIANT=cross-compile
export CROSS_COMPILE=/usr/bin/arm-none-eabi-
```

Your setup is now complete.
