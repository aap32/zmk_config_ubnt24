ZMK, being built on [Zephyr™](https://zephyrproject.org/), is very modular and flexible. This allows users to combine features, flags, and properties to "construct" features in ZMK, without the need to modify the underlying source code.

These pages are a collection of guides for users who want a _bit_ more out of their ZMK devices, without the need to delve into the [Zephyr™](https://zephyrproject.org/) documentation. Guides aimed at keyboard designers are also found under this section.
