## Summary

The caps word behavior behaves similar to a caps lock, but will automatically deactivate when any key in a word separator list is pressed, or if the caps word key is pressed again.

### Behavior Binding

- Reference: `&caps_word`

Example:

```
&caps_word
```

See [caps lock](/docs/behaviors/capslock)
