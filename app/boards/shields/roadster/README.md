Shield configuration by R. KOLLINGER III for the ROADSTER by clawboards.xyz

I do not own the rights to the Roadster keyboard but wanted to use it with the nice!nano and had to make this
configuration myself. No guarantees that it will work, use at your own risk. I am not liable for any damage
made to your keyboard or PC by using this configuration.
